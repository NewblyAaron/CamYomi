# CamYomi

CamYomi is an Android app designed to recognize Japanese text using Optical Character Recognition (OCR) and provide definitions for the recognized text. The app utilizes Google MLKit's Text Recognition v2 feature for OCR and uses local JMdict XML files for offline definition lookup.

## Features

- **OCR Text Recognition**: Capture or select an image containing Japanese text, and the app will recognize and extract the text using Google MLKit's Text Recognizer.
- **Offline Definitions**: Lookup definitions of the recognized Japanese text using JMdict, an XML-based dictionary that is bundled with the app.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Simple and intuitive user interface to capture or select images and view text and definitions.

## Usage

1. **Launch the App**: Open the app on your Android device.
2. **Capture or Select Image**: Tap on the button to launch the camera and capture an image. Or select an image from the media picker.
3. **View Recognized Text**: The app will process the image and display the recognized Japanese text.
4. **View Definitions**: Definitions for the recognized text will be displayed, fetched from the locally stored JMdict.
